# Git Hooks: Automate Git Actions

## What Are Git Hooks?
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events happen, like committing, merging, or pushing. They help automate tasks, enforce rules, or add extra features to your Git workflow.

These hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks/` folder inside your repository and can be written in languages like Bash, Python, or others your system supports.

#

**1. Client-Side Hooks**

These hooks run on the `developer’s machine` and are used for tasks like:

- Validating commit messages.
- Checking for code style issues.
- Running automated tests before a commit or push

Examples:
- `pre-commit`
- `commit-msg`
- `pre-push`

**2. Server-Side Hook**

These hooks run on the `server` where the repository is hosted and are used for:

- Enforcing access control.
- Validating pushed commits.
- Preventing branch deletions.

Examples:

- `pre-receive`
- `post-receive`

## 1. Pre-commit Hook (Checking for todo )

- **Pre-commit Hook**
    - `Purpose:` Checks changes before committing.
    - `Example:` Rejects commits containing `TODO` comments.

### `Script:`
```
#!/bin/bash
# Check for TODO comments in the files staged for commit
echo "Checking for TODO comments..."
if git grep --cached -q 'TODO'; then
echo "Commit rejected: Found 'TODO' comments in your code."
exit 1
fi
echo "No TODO comments found. Proceeding with commit."
exit 0
```
### `Setup and Operation`
- Initialize a Git Repository:
```
 git init
```
- Move the Hook Script to `.git/hooks/:`
```
 mv pre-commit .git/hooks/
```
- Make the Hook Executable:
``` 
 chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
- Normal add (Hook file)
```
 git add new_script.py
```
- Normal Commit (Hook Executes):
```
 git commit -m "test commit" # Runs hook, fails if TODO is found
```
- Bypass the Hook:
```
 git commit -m "test commit" --no-verify # Bypass the hook
```
## 2. Commit-msg Hook: Validating Commit Message

- **Commit-msg Hook**

    - `Purpose:` Validates commit messages.
    - `Example:` Ensures commit messages start with a capital lette

### `Script`
```
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure commit message starts with a capital letter
echo "Validating commit message..."
commit_message_file=$1
commit_message=$(cat "$commit_message_file")
if [[ ! $commit_message =~ ^[A-Z] ]]; then
  echo "Commit rejected: Commit message must start with a capital letter."
  exit 1
fi
echo "Commit message validated. Proceeding with commit."
exit 0

```

### `Setup and Operation`

- Initialize a Git Repository:
```
git init
```
- Move the Hook Script to `.git/hooks/:`
```
mv commit-msg .git/hooks/
```
- Make the Hook Executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

- Normal Commit (Hook Executes):

```
git commit -m "test commit"
```

- Bypass the Hook:
```
git commit -m "test commit" --no-verify
```

## 3. Pre-push Hook: Prevent Pushing to a Specific Branch
- **Pre-push Hook**
    - `Purpose:` Runs checks before pushing.
    - `Example:` Prevents pushes to the main branch.

### `Script`
```
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent pushing to the main branch
protected_branch="main"
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [ "$current_branch" = "$protected_branch" ]; then
  echo "Push rejected: Pushing to the '$protected_branch' branch is not allowed."
  exit 1
fi
echo "Push validation passed. Proceeding with push."
exit 0

```
### `Setup and Operation`
- Initialize a Git Repository:
```
git init
```
- Move the Hook Script to `.git/hooks/:`
```
mv pre-push .git/hooks/
```
- Make the Hook Executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```
- Normal Push (Hook Executes):

```
git push origin main

```

- Bypass the Hook:
```
git push origin main --no-verify

```

## 4. Pre-receive Hook: Reject Pushes with Debug Statements

- **Pre-receive Hook**
    - `Purpose:` Validates pushes on the server.
    - `Example:` Rejects pushes containing debug statements.

### `Script`
```
#!/bin/bash
# Reject pushes containing "debugger" or "console.log"
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  if git diff --name-only "$oldrev" "$newrev" | xargs grep -E 'debugger|console.log'; then
    echo "Push rejected: Found debug statements in your code."
    exit 1
  fi
done
echo "Pre-receive validation passed. Proceeding with push."
exit 0

```
### `Setup and Operation`

- Move the Hook Script to the Server’s Git Repository .git/hooks/:
```
mv pre-receive .git/hooks/
```
- Make the Hook Executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-receive
```
- Attempt to Push:

- Normal Push (Hook Executes):
```
git push
```
If debug statements are found, the push will fail.

- Bypass the Hook (`Not Allowed for Pre-receive`): Not possible to bypass `server-side hooks`.

## 5. Post-receive Hook: Notify of Successful Push
- **Post-receive Hook**
    - `Purpose:` Executes actions after a push.
    - `Example:` Sends notifications about successful pushes.
    
### `Script`
```
#!/bin/bash
# Notify the team about a successful push
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref "$refname")
  echo "Push successful to branch: $branch"
  echo "Notify team about the push on branch $branch." | mail -s "Git Push Notification" team@example.com
done
exit 0

```
### `Setup and Operation`

- Move the Hook Script to the Server’s Git Repository `.git/hooks/:`
```
mv post-receive .git/hooks/
```
- Make the Hook Executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive
```
- Push Changes:
```
git push
```
On a successful push, the script will send an email notification.

## Commands Recap
### Move the hook to `.git/hooks/:`
```
mv <hook-name> .git/hooks/
```
### Make the hook executable.
- `chmod +x .git/hooks/<hook-name>`
### Bypass client-side hooks (if allowed):
```
git commit/push --no-verify
```
