# Rebase and Reflog in Git
## 1. Rebase in git
`Git rebase` is a powerful feature that lets you change the base of a branch. Essentially, it allows you to move a branch to a new starting point by “replaying” its commits onto a different commit. This helps maintain a cleaner and more linear project history.

Many developers prefer using rebase instead of merge because it keeps the commit history tidy and easy to follow. It also lets you make code changes without impacting the original branch.

### `1. Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase: `
```
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
### `2. Resolve any conflicts: `
If there are any conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually. You can use the merge tool in VSCode to resolve the conflicts.
```
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```
> Notte: Try to avoid `--force` option when using rebase. It can cause issues with the project history.
