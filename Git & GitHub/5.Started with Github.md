# Getting started with Github

## Github
Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on projects and to share code.

## GitHub SSH connection

### 1. Check for Existing SSH Keys
Before generating a new SSH key, check if you already have an SSH key pair.
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
Look for files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. If you see them, you already have an SSH key. You can skip the key generation step and move to adding the key to GitHub.

### 2. Generate a New SSH Key
If you don't have an SSH key, generate one with the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key to create (RSA).
- `-b 4096`: Sets the key length to 4096 bits for stronger security.
- `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a comment (usually your email) to the key for identification.
You'll be prompted to save the key to a specific location (press `Enter` to accept the default path). You can also set a passphrase to add an extra layer of security.

### 3. Add SSH Key to GitHub
Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
**Copy the output.**

### Add the key to GitHub:
- Go to `GitHub `> `Settings` > `SSH` and `GPG` keys.
- Click `New SSH key`.
- `Paste` the public key into the "Key" field and give it a title (e.g., "My SSH Key").
- Click `Add SSH key`.
### 4. Test the Connection
To verify that everything is set up correctly, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If the connection is successful, you will see a message like:
```bash
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```




### `1. Configure your config file`
If you havnâ€™t done it already, you need to configure your git config file.
```
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
- `Example`

```
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
- ` check`
```
git config --list
```

### `2. Adding code to remote repository`

Create a new Repo on your system first, add some code and commit it.

```
git init
git add <files>
git commit -m "commit message"
```
### `3. Check remote url setting`
```
git remote -v
```

### `4. Add remote repository`
```
git remote add origin <remote-url>
```
- `Example`
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### `5. Push code to remote repository`
```
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```
- `Example`
```
git push origin main
```

### `6. Get code from remote repository`

There are two ways to get code from a remote repository:

- fetch the code
- pull the code

- `Fetch code`
```
git fetch <remote-name>
```
- `Pull code`
```
git pull origin main
```
