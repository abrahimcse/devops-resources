# Branched in git

Branches let you work on different versions of a project at the same time. They create a separate area where you can make changes without affecting the main project. This is helpful when you want to try new features or fix bugs without disturbing the main branch. Once your work is done, you can bring those changes back into the main project.

## 1. Creating a new branch

To create a new branch, you can use the following command:

```
git branch
git branch little-feature
git switch little-feature
git log
git switch master
git switch -c Big-feature
git checkout Bug-Fix

```

**Some points to note:***

- `git branch` - This command lists all the branches in the current repository.
- `git branch little-feature` - This command creates a new branch called `little-feature`.
- `git switch little-feature` - This command switches to the `little-feature` branch.
- `git log` - This command shows the commit history for the current branch.
- `git switch master` - This command switches to the `master branch`.
- `git switch -c Big-feature` - This command creates a new branch called `Big-feature`. the `-c` flag is used to create a new branch.
- `git checkout Bug-Fix` - This command switches to the `Bug-Fix` branch.

    - ***`Commit` before switching to a branch***

    - ***Go to `.git` folder and checkout to the `HEAD` file***

## 2. Merging branches
### i. Fast-forward merge
This one is easy as branch that you are trying to merge is usually ahead and there are no conflicts.

```
git checkout main
git merge little-feature
```
![]()

**Some points :**

- `git checkout main` - This command switches to the main branch.
- `git merge little-feature` - This command merges the `little-feature`branch into the main branch.
