# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
*Official Documentation: [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)*

## 1. Core Components
### Identity Types & Limits
| Entity       | Max/Account | Key Characteristics                     |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Users**    | 5,000       | Permanent credentials, MFA support       |
| **Groups**   | 300         | No nesting, users can belong to multiple |
| **Roles**    | 1,000       | Temporary credentials (1-12h sessions)   |

> 1. ðŸ‘¤ IAM Users

- Represents human users or applications.
- Can have:
    - Console access (via username/password)
    - Programmatic access (via access keys)
- Best Practices:
    - Do not use root account for daily operations.
    - Use least privilege principle.
    - Enforce password policies and MFA.

> 2. ðŸ‘¥ IAM Groups
- Collection of IAM users.
- Permissions applied to the group are inherited by its members.
- Makes managing users easier (e.g., give all developers S3 access).
- Example groups:
    - `Admins` â€“ Full access
    - `Developers` â€“ EC2, S3 read/write
    - `Viewers` â€“ Read-only permissions

> 3. ðŸŽ­ IAM Roles

- Used to delegate permissions to:
    - AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda)
    - IAM users
    - Cross-account access
    - Federated users (SSO, Google, Active Directory)
- **No permanent credentials;** uses temporary tokens.
- Example: An EC2 instance can assume a role to access S3 securely.

## 2. Policy Framework
### Policy Types Comparison

    title Policy Types
    "Managed Policies" : 45
    "Inline Policies" : 30
    "SCPs" : 25
```

### Key Syntax Elements:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:Get*", "s3:List*"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
    "Condition": {"IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"}}
  }
}
```

## Policy Types Overview

### 1. Managed Policies (45%)
**Characteristics**:
- Reusable policies that can be attached to multiple IAM identities
- Can be AWS-managed or customer-managed
- Centrally managed for easy updates

**When to Use**

âœ… Standard permission sets (e.g., ReadOnlyAccess)  
âœ… Common access patterns across multiple users/roles  
âœ… Environments requiring consistent permissions

**Example AWS-Managed Policies**:
- `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
- `AdministratorAccess`
- `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`

### 2. Inline Policies (30%)
**Characteristics**:
- Embedded directly into a single IAM identity
- Deleted when the identity is deleted
- Useful for unique permission requirements

**When to Use**:

âœ… One-off permission requirements  
âœ… Temporary access needs  
âœ… Highly specific resource access

**Example Use Case**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "dynamodb:PutItem",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/SpecificTable"
  }]
}
```
### 3. Service Control Policies - SCPs (25%)
**Characteristics:**
- Applied at AWS Organizations level
- Act as permission guardrails
- Affect all identities in member accounts

**When to Use:**

âœ… Organization-wide security boundaries
âœ… Preventing prohibited actions across accounts
âœ… Implementing compliance requirements

**Example Restriction:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "s3:DeleteBucket",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

## 3. Security Controls
### Critical Features
1. MFA Enforcement

```bash
aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name Alice --serial-number arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/Alice --authentication-code-1 123456 --authentication-code-2 789012
```
2. Credential Rotation
- Access Keys: Rotate every 90 days
- Use [Credential Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html) for auditing

3. Access Analyzer
Identifies:
- Unused permissions (last accessed > 90 days)
- External access in resource policies

## 4. Interview Q&A
### Technical Questions
> Q1. Explain the difference between IAM roles and users?
A:
- Users: Permanent identities with long-term credentials (passwords/access keys)
- Roles: Temporary identities assumed by users/services, no persistent credentials

> Q2. How does policy evaluation work in IAM?
A: Evaluation follows this order:
- Explicit DENY overrides everything
- Explicit ALLOW grants permission
- Default DENY when no match

Ref: *[Policy Evaluation Logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html)*

**Scenario-Based Questions**
> Q3. How would you grant cross-account S3 access?
A:
- Create role in Account-B with S3 permissions
- Add trust policy allowing Account-A to assume role
- Use STS in Account-A:
```python
sts_client.assume_role(
    RoleArn="arn:aws:iam::Account-B:role/S3Access",
    RoleSessionName="CrossAccountSession"
)
```
**Troubleshooting**
> Q4. A user reports "Access Denied" despite having correct permissions. What would you check?
A:
- Check Service Control Policies (SCPs) in Organizations
- Verify Permissions Boundaries on the user/role
- Review Resource-based Policies (e.g., S3 bucket policy)
- Check for Explicit Denies in policies

> 5. Best Practices Checklist
- Enable MFA for root and privileged users
- Use roles instead of users for AWS services
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Regularly review permissions using Access Advisor
- Rotate credentials every 90 days
