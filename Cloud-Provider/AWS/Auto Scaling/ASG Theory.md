# 🚀 AWS Auto Scaling – Interview Ready Notes

A complete guide to understanding and revising AWS Auto Scaling for interviews and real-world use.

---

## 📌 What is AWS Auto Scaling?

AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances (or other scalable services) in response to demand.

### 🔍 Why Use It?
- ✅ High availability
- 💵 Cost-efficiency (scale down during idle times)
- 🚀 Performance optimization (scale up during load)

---

## 🧠 Types of Auto Scaling

| Type                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **EC2 Auto Scaling**        | For scaling EC2 instances only |
| **Application Auto Scaling** | For other services like ECS, DynamoDB, Aurora, Lambda etc |

---

## 📊 Scaling Policies

### 🎯 Target Tracking Policy
- Like a thermostat — keeps a metric (e.g., CPU) at a target value.
- Example: Keep CPU at 50%

### 📈 Step Scaling Policy
- Adds/removes instances in steps depending on metric breach levels.

### 📅 Scheduled Scaling
- Scale at specific times (e.g., add instances at 9 AM)

## 🛠 Key Components

| Component            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Launch Template**      | Defines how new instances should be launched (AMI, type, key, etc.) |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** | Logical grouping of instances to be scaled |
| **Scaling Policy**        | Rules on when and how to scale |
| **CloudWatch Alarm**      | Monitors metrics to trigger policies |

---

## 🧰 CLI Setup Example

```bash
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group \
  --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --launch-template LaunchTemplateName=my-template \
  --min-size 2 \
  --max-size 10 \
  --desired-capacity 3 \
  --vpc-zone-identifier subnet-abc12345
```

---

## 🔍 CloudWatch Alarm Example

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name high-cpu-alarm \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 60 \
  --threshold 70 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 2 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:autoscaling:...:policy/scale-out \
  --dimensions Name=AutoScalingGroupName,Value=my-asg
```

---

## 🔄 Scaling Scenarios

- 📈 During flash sales, traffic spikes → Auto Scaling adds instances.
- 📉 At night, traffic drops → Auto Scaling reduces instance count.

---

## 🔗 Integration Tips

- ✅ **With ELB**: Routes traffic across scaled instances.
- ✅ **With CloudWatch**: Trigger alarms based on CPU, memory, etc.
- ✅ **With Terraform**: Automate setup using infrastructure as code.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Not setting proper min/max limits
- ❌ No CloudWatch alarm configured
- ❌ Using Launch Configuration (use Launch Template instead)
- ❌ Not attaching ELB → traffic not balanced
- ❌ Ignoring cooldown period → frequent scale in/out

## 💬 Quick FAQs (for Interview)

**Q: Can Auto Scaling replace unhealthy EC2 instances?**  
➡️ Yes, if health check fails, ASG replaces it.

**Q: Which policy is easiest to maintain?**  
➡️ Target Tracking Policy.

**Q: Can I scale based on memory usage?**  
➡️ Not by default; requires custom CloudWatch metrics.

**Q: What is the difference between desired and max capacity?**  
➡️ Desired is the target number of instances; max is the upper limit.
